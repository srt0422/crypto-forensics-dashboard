-- Create a test user for authentication testing
-- Note: This is a simplified approach for testing purposes
-- In production, users should be created through the proper signup flow

-- Insert test user data (this will be handled by Supabase auth in the actual implementation)
-- We'll create the user through the auth.users table managed by Supabase
-- Email: test@example.com
-- Password: testpassword123

-- Since we can't directly insert into auth.users (managed by Supabase),
-- we'll need to use the Supabase dashboard or API to create the test user
-- But we can prepare any related tables if needed

-- For now, let's just document the test credentials that should be created:
-- Email: test@example.com  
-- Password: testpassword123

-- This comment serves as documentation for the test user that needs to be created
